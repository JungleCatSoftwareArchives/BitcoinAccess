**Leave your wallet.dat at home!**
BitcoinAccess is an Android Bitcoin RPC client. To function, it requires a Bitcoin RPC server running on a desktop or server to connect to in order to send and view transactions. It does not store any blockchain or wallet information on your device, as it gets all the information it needs from your desktop Bitcoin client.
